# sha_256

<p>This is a simple implementation of SHA256 hashing function. It is free to use for anyone. Currently works only for strings shorter than 55. </p>

## About

<p>SHA256 (SecureHashAlgorithm) is a part of SHA2 family of algorithms published in 2001. It's a compression function that works with an input of 512bit wide blocks of messages and outputs 256-bit wide HASH values. It is used for authentication and encryption protocols. </p>

## Example

input string: **AlokinCitac**

Output HASH:    **d8662cd9894b29a88c0463b523514a837031e6dde61cfd9bf29ddc89130e2290**
Expected HASH:  **d8662cd9894b29a88c0463b523514a837031e6dde61cfd9bf29ddc89130e2290**
